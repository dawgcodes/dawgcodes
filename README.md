## Hello!
... And welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm **David Ian Black**, a self-taught Developer (obviously with the help of various online communities)

I know a few programming languages but I only **code in TypeScript** cuz why not

I'm better at **backend** compared to I'm at frontend but I can do full stack since I'm already doing it, all **with TypeScript**

I'm currently working on [Reedroux Bot](https://reedroux.biz/), an **advanced Discord music bot** developed and owned by me, **used by** over **10,000+ servers**!
